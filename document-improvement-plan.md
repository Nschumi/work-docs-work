# Document Improvement Plan - SAGA Telecom eCommerce Module

**Session Date:** 2025-07-09  
**Principal Engineer:** Claude Code  
**Objective:** Improve project charter and SRS documents to serve as north star for engineering teams

---

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the systematic improvement of two critical project documents:
1. **Project Charter** - Mostly complete, needs engineering-focused enhancements
2. **SRS Document** - Work in progress, needs completion and technical depth

**Goal:** Transform these documents into comprehensive guides that align business and engineering needs while providing clear direction for development teams.

---

## Document Assessment Status

### Project Charter (`charter/project-charter.md`)
- **Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Mostly Complete - Needs Refinement
- **Strengths:** Clear business problem, well-defined scope, good stakeholder identification
- **Critical Gaps:** Technical constraints, engineering success metrics, resource planning

### SRS Document (`SRS/ecom-srs.md`)
- **Status:** ðŸŸ  Work in Progress - Needs Completion
- **Strengths:** Comprehensive functional requirements, good module breakdown
- **Critical Gaps:** Technical architecture, quality requirements, implementation guidance

## Improvement Plan Phases

### Phase 1: Project Charter Enhancement
**Priority:** High | **Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours | **Status:** âœ… Complete

**Summary of Accomplishments:**
- Added comprehensive Technical Architecture section with verified technology decisions
- Created measurable Engineering Success Metrics focused on proactive monitoring
- Developed Resource Planning with team structure and skill requirements
- Created 3 questionnaires to verify assumptions and gather stakeholder input
- Removed specific budget figures per stakeholder request for planning flexibility
- Charter now serves as effective "north star" for engineering teams

#### 1.1 Technical Constraints & Architecture Section
- [x] Add technology stack decisions and rationale
- [x] Include performance requirements and SLA targets
- [x] Define security and compliance requirements
- [x] Document integration constraints with legacy systems
- [x] Create technical architecture questionnaire to verify assumptions

#### 1.2 Engineering Success Metrics
- [x] Define specific performance benchmarks
- [x] Add measurable business outcomes
- [x] Include technical quality gates
- [x] Create monitoring and observability metrics
- [x] Create success metrics questionnaire to verify assumptions
- [x] Refine metrics based on stakeholder feedback for measurability

#### 1.3 Resource Planning & Infrastructure
- [x] Detail team size and skill requirements
- [x] Specify infrastructure and tooling needs
- [x] Add budget estimates for different phases (later removed per stakeholder request)
- [x] Document external dependencies and vendor requirements
- [x] Create resource planning questionnaire for verification
- [x] Remove specific cost estimates to allow flexible planning

#### 1.4 Development Process Framework
- [x] Define Architecture Decision Records (ADR) process
- [x] Establish code review and quality standards
- [x] Document DevOps and deployment strategy
- [x] Add risk mitigation strategies

---

### Phase 3: Validation & Refinement
**Priority:** Medium | **Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours | **Status:** ðŸ”„ Not Started

#### 3.1 Document Review & Consistency
- [ ] Cross-reference between charter and SRS
- [ ] Ensure technical alignment across documents
- [ ] Validate business-engineering alignment
- [ ] Check for gaps or contradictions

#### 3.2 Engineering Team Perspective
- [ ] Ensure documents serve as "north star" reference
- [ ] Validate technical feasibility of requirements
- [ ] Confirm implementation guidance is actionable
- [ ] Verify monitoring and success metrics are measurable

#### 3.3 Final Polish & Formatting
- [ ] Improve document structure and navigation
- [ ] Add cross-references and links
- [ ] Ensure consistent formatting and style
- [ ] Add executive summaries where needed

## Key Principles for Improvements

### Business-Engineering Alignment
- Every business requirement must have technical implementation guidance
- Technical decisions must be traceable to business objectives
- Clear definition of "done" for each requirement

### North Star Characteristics
- Documents should answer "what to build" and "how to build it"
- Provide clear decision-making frameworks
- Include measurable success criteria
- Enable autonomous team decision-making

### Development Team Support
- Clear architectural constraints and patterns
- Specific quality and performance targets
- Actionable implementation guidance
- Troubleshooting and debugging support

---

## Success Criteria

### Project Charter Improvements
- [x] Clear technical constraints and architecture decisions
- [x] Measurable engineering success metrics
- [x] Comprehensive resource and infrastructure planning
- [x] Defined development processes and standards

### SRS Document Completion
- [ ] Complete technical architecture section
- [ ] Comprehensive quality requirements
- [ ] Detailed implementation guidance
- [ ] All sections completed and consistent

### Overall Document Quality
- [ ] Documents serve as effective north star for engineering teams
- [ ] Clear alignment between business and technical requirements
- [ ] Actionable guidance for development teams
- [ ] Measurable success criteria and monitoring approaches
