# Multi-Tenant Telecom eCom Platform - Project Document

## Executive Summary

This project document outlines the development of a comprehensive multi-tenant telecom eCommerce platform designed as a white-label solution for telecom brands. The platform enables rapid deployment of branded digital commerce experiences while sharing common infrastructure and reducing operational overhead.

The solution addresses the critical challenge of current legacy systems that require months-long deployment cycles and complete code duplication for new tenants. Our target is to reduce tenant onboarding from months to 2-3 weeks through a modern, scalable architecture built on .NET 9 with modular monolith patterns.

## Business Context and Objectives

### Business Challenge

Nuuday Mobile Partners faces significant challenges in digital commerce deployment:

- The existing e-commerce system is built on a legacy, single-tenant platform (TCM), requiring each brand partner to operate a separate website instance.

- This setup limits flexibility for brand partners, making it difficult to independently manage products, pricing, and campaigns without IT involvement.

- Brand partners face delays in launching new products or adjusting offerings due to the lack of centralized, self-service tools and cumbersome update processes

- Operational inefficiencies arise from duplicated efforts in maintaining separate site instances and inconsistent product management workflows

- The rigidity of the legacy system hinders rapid adaptation to market changes, impacting both time-to-market and the ability to respond to customer needs

### Strategic Goals

- **Accelerated Time-to-Market**: Reduce tenant onboarding from months to 2-3 weeks
- **Cost Efficiency**: Shared infrastructure reducing operational overhead by 50%
- **Scalability**: Support for 1000+ concurrent users
- **Brand Independence**: Complete white-label capabilities with custom domain support
- **Operational Excellence**: 99.9% availability with automated deployment capabilities

### Value Proposition

The platform provides Brand Partners with a modern, cost-effective digital commerce solution that enables rapid market entry, complete brand customization, and enterprise-grade reliability. This addresses the current inability to onboard new tenants due to legacy system limitations.

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Modular Monolith Foundation

The platform utilizes a modular monolith architecture powered by .NET 9 and .NET Aspire, providing the organizational benefits of microservices while maintaining deployment simplicity. Each module encapsulates specific business functionality with well-defined interfaces and boundaries.

### Multi-Tenancy Strategy

The system implements shared database and schema architecture using TenantId-based data isolation. This approach provides operational efficiency while ensuring complete data separation between tenants through Entity Framework global query filters and tenant-aware middleware.

### Infrastructure and Deployment

The platform deploys to Kubernetes clusters with nginx ingress capabilities and horizontal pod autoscaling. This ensures scalability, reliability, and efficient resource utilization across multiple tenants while supporting custom domain configurations for complete brand independence.

### Development Foundation

.NET Aspire provides the core orchestration foundation with unified debugging capabilities, service discovery, and configuration management. This creates a streamlined development experience enabling effective local development workflows independent of production systems.
