- **High Cohesion**: Each module encapsulates specific business functionality
- **Low Coupling**: Modules interact through well-defined interfaces
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Common components for authentication, logging, and monitoring
- **Independent Deployment**: Modules can be deployed independently when needed

### .NET Aspire Foundation

The project structure utilizes .NET Aspire for orchestration and development experience, providing:

**AspireHost Project**: Orchestrator for connecting and configuring different services and components
**ServiceDefaults Project**: Shared configurations for resilience, service discovery, and telemetry
**Modular Services**: Individual service projects with Aspire integration
**Development Tooling**: Unified debugging experience across distributed components

### Multi-Tenancy Strategy

#### Data Isolation Approach

The platform implements shared database and schema architecture with tenant-based data isolation:

```csharp
// Tenant-aware entity base class
public abstract class TenantEntity
{
    public Guid Id { get; init; }
    public Guid TenantId { get; init; }  // Tenant isolation key
    public DateTimeOffset CreatedAt { get; init; }
    public DateTimeOffset UpdatedAt { get; init; }
}

// EF Core global query filtering
modelBuilder.Entity<CatalogItem>().HasQueryFilter(e =>
    e.TenantId == _tenantContext.CurrentTenantId);
```

#### Tenant Resolution Strategy

Tenant context resolution uses custom domain-based identification:
