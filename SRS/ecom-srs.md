## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

The SAGA Telecom eCommerce Module operates as a Tier 3 component within the SAGA platform architecture. It interfaces with multiple systems including the legacy TCM system (Via Product Service) for product data and MSISDN availability, SAGA Tier 2 core services for centralized platform functionality, downstream provisioning systems for subscription activation, payment gateways for transaction processing, and the Open Pages project for frontend product visualization capabilities.

### 2.2 Product Functions

The system provides comprehensive eCommerce functionality including multi-tenant management with complete isolation of brand partner data and configurations, product catalog management for creating telecom product offerings, digital channel management for configuring product visibility, order processing with end-to-end lifecycle management, payment processing with secure handling of (potential) multiple payment methods, number management for telephone number inventory, administration through a comprehensive partner management interface, and whitelabel frontend capabilities enabling brand partners to customize storefront branding, layout, and product presentation.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

**Brand Partner Administrators** (e.g., Katrine Grøn Iversen, Katrine Blicher Christensen) manage product catalogs and pricing for their brands, configure channel visibility and promotional campaigns, customize whitelabel storefronts, and monitor order status with medium technical expertise and daily usage frequency. **API Consumers** integrate telecom products into their applications, access product catalogs programmatically, require high technical expertise, and use the system continuously. **End Customers** browse and purchase telecom products through whitelabel storefronts, manage orders and account information, have low to medium technical expertise, and use the system occasionally. **System Administrators** manage tenant onboarding and system configuration, monitor performance, resolve issues, require high technical expertise, and use the system daily.

### 2.4 Operating Environment

The system operates on a C#/.NET modular monolith architecture with multi-tenant database architecture ensuring tenant isolation. It deploys on scalable cloud infrastructure supporting multiple availability zones, uses REST APIs and message queues for integration protocols, and implements OAuth 2.0, role-based access control, and data encryption for security.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

The system must maintain compatibility with legacy TCM system interfaces via Product Service, requires strict tenant data isolation for compliance and security, must support horizontal scaling for growth accommodation, has integration dependencies on Open Pages project timeline, must comply with telecom industry regulations and data privacy standards, and must ensure responsive design across web and mobile platforms for whitelabel storefronts.

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies

**Assumptions** include that the legacy TCM system will remain available for data retrieval during transition, brand partners will provide necessary branding assets and configuration requirements, Infrastructure & Platform team resources will be consistently available, payment gateway integrations will meet industry security standards, and brand partners will actively engage in frontend customization processes. **Dependencies** include the legacy TCM system via Product Service for product and MSISDN data availability, Open Pages project for frontend whitelabel capabilities, downstream provisioning systems for subscription activation, and SAGA Tier 2 core services for platform-wide functionality.

## 3. External Interface Requirements

### 3.1 User Interfaces

**Administration Portal** provides a web-based responsive interface supporting desktop and tablet access, role-based dashboards with customizable widgets, real-time data updates and notifications, and comprehensive frontend customization tools allowing brand partners to configure logos, color schemes, domain settings, and layout preferences. **Whitelabel Customer Storefronts** offer fully customizable, responsive web interfaces that reflect each brand partner's visual identity, support dynamic product display based on channel configurations, enable seamless customer journeys from product discovery through checkout, and ensure accessibility compliance across devices and platforms. **API Interfaces** offer RESTful API endpoints with comprehensive documentation, OAuth 2.0 authentication, standardized error responses and status codes, API versioning support for backward compatibility, and frontend configuration APIs for programmatic customization.

### 3.2 Hardware Interfaces

The system is compatible with standard cloud computing platforms, supports high-availability load balancing configurations, uses multi-tenant database deployment with backup systems, integrates with infrastructure monitoring tools including CCCoE maintained Grafana visualization, and supports content delivery networks (CDNs) for optimal frontend performance across geographic regions.

### 3.3 Software Interfaces

**Legacy TCM System Integration** is proxied by SAGA Product Service which secures REST API for needed data availability, system-to-system authentication tokens, and functions for product data retrieval, pricing information, and MSISDN availability. **Payment Gateway Integration** uses REST APIs with webhook support, PCI DSS compliant communication, supports credit cards and digital wallets, with functions for authorization, capture, refund, and recurring payments. **SAGA Tier 2 Integration** uses internal API calls and message queues with JSON over HTTPS, internal service authentication, and functions for user management, audit logging, and system configuration. **Contentful CMS Integration** provides dynamic content updates, branding asset management, and real-time configuration changes for whitelabel storefronts through RESTful API integration.

### 3.4 Communication Interfaces

All external communications are encrypted with HTTPS and TLS 1.3, message queues handle asynchronous processing for order fulfillment, webhooks provide real-time notifications for payment and order status updates, email/SMS deliver customer notifications and administrative alerts, and real-time APIs support dynamic frontend updates and configuration changes.
