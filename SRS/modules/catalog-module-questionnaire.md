**Purpose:** Validate assumptions and gather detailed requirements for the Catalog Module  
**Date:** 2025-07-10  
**Reviewer:** Niclas Schumacher  
**Module:** Catalog Module (Phase 1 Priority)

---

## Instructions

Please review each assumption and provide feedback. Mark each item as:

- ✅ **CORRECT** - Assumption is accurate and aligns with business needs
- ❌ **INCORRECT** - Assumption is wrong (please provide correct details)
- ❓ **UNCLEAR** - Need clarification or more context
- ➡️ **MODIFY** - Directionally correct but needs adjustment

---

## 1. Product Item Management

### 1.1 Basic Product Structure

**Assumption:** A "product item" represents a telecom subscription offering that references a legacy TCM subscription ID but allows brand partners to add their own pricing, campaigns, and metadata.

**Status:** [X] ✅ CORRECT | [ ] ❌ INCORRECT | [ ] ❓ UNCLEAR | [ ] ➡️ MODIFY

**If needs adjustment:**

- Actual product structure: This is valid, though it is retrieved through the SAGA Product Service, not directly from TCM, which give us more flexibility.
- Key product attributes: \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

---

### 1.2 Product Creation Process

**Assumption:** Brand partners will create products by:

1. Entering a valid legacy subscription ID
2. Adding their own pricing and binding period
3. Optionally adding campaign/promotional information
4. Setting product name, description, and marketing content

**Status:** [ ] ✅ CORRECT | [ ] ❌ INCORRECT | [ ] ❓ UNCLEAR | [X] ➡️ MODIFY

**If needs adjustment:**

- Actual creation process: \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***
- Required vs. optional fields: Pricing and binding period is optional since there might be some infomation that is derived from the actual subscription.
  When thinking of it, we cant manipulat the price directly, only indirectly through campaigns.

---

### 1.3 Product Variants

**Assumption:** Brand partners want to create multiple "variants" of the same subscription ID with different:

- Campaign offers (e.g., "Summer Sale", "Student Discount")
- Binding periods (1, 6, 12, 24, 36 months)
- Pricing structures

**Status:** [X] ✅ CORRECT | [ ] ❌ INCORRECT | [ ] ❓ UNCLEAR | [ ] ➡️ MODIFY

**If needs adjustment:**

- What makes a variant different: \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***
- Maximum variants per subscription: \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***
- Variant naming strategy: \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

---

## 2. Legacy TCM System Integration

### 2.1 Data Retrieval from TCM

**Assumption:** The system will retrieve from TCM:

- Basic subscription information (name, description, base pricing)
- Available datacards with data allowance limits
- Available SIM card types
- Available add-on modules (e.g., 5G) with pricing
- Current availability status

**Status:** [X] ✅ CORRECT | [ ] ❌ INCORRECT | [ ] ❓ UNCLEAR | [ ] ➡️ MODIFY

**If needs adjustment:**

- Additional data needed from TCM: Above is true, though the Catalog service Catalog Item will control whether or not these properties might be optional for the end user.
- Data that should NOT come from TCM: \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

---

### 2.2 Pricing Strategy

**Assumption:** Brand partners can set their own pricing that may be different from TCM system pricing, and local pricing takes precedence for customer-facing operations.

**Status:** [X] ✅ CORRECT | [ ] ❌ INCORRECT | [ ] ❓ UNCLEAR | [ ] ➡️ MODIFY

**If needs adjustment:**

- Pricing rules: \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***
- Price override capabilities: A product actually have two prices, a subscription price as well as a initial price. Often the initial price is 0, but it can be set to a value as well.
  To the best of my knowledge, the subscription price that is in TCM, is the price that the customer will pay, so if we want to manipulate this price, this should be done through campaigns.
- TCM vs. local pricing priority: \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

---

### 2.3 TCM System Reliability

**Assumption:** When TCM system is unavailable, the catalog should continue working with cached product data, but new product creation should be blocked until TCM is accessible again.

**Status:** [X] ✅ CORRECT | [ ] ❌ INCORRECT | [ ] ❓ UNCLEAR | [ ] ➡️ MODIFY

**If needs adjustment:**

- Fallback strategy: \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***
- Cache duration: \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***
- Operations allowed during TCM outage: \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

---

## 3. Product Organization & Categories

### 3.1 Product Categories

**Assumption:** Brand partners will want to organize products into categories like:

- Mobile plans (prepaid, postpaid)
- Internet plans (fiber, mobile broadband)
- Business solutions
- Add-ons and extras

**Status:** [X] ✅ CORRECT | [ ] ❌ INCORRECT | [ ] ❓ UNCLEAR | [ ] ➡️ MODIFY

**If needs adjustment:**

- Preferred category structure: \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***
- Should categories be predefined or custom: \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***
- Category hierarchy depth: \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

something like it, though currently there are more or less only two types of products, mobile and mobile broadband.

---

### 3.2 Product Search and Discovery

**Assumption:** API consumers and partners will need to search products by:

- Product name and description
- Price range
- Data allowance

- Discounts cannot exceed 50% of base price
- Price changes require audit trail for compliance

**Status:** [X] ✅ CORRECT | [ ] ❌ INCORRECT | [ ] ❓ UNCLEAR | [ ] ➡️ MODIFY

**If needs adjustment:**

- Pricing validation rules: \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***
- Discount limits: Discount can be anything, since it is often used to give a 0 price for the first month, or a 0 price for the first 6 months.
- Currency requirements: Currency is always DKK.

---

### 4.2 Product Lifecycle

**Assumption:** Products have states: Draft → Active → Inactive, where:

- Draft: Being created, not visible to customers
- Active: Available for purchase
- Inactive: Hidden from new orders but existing orders continue

**Status:** [X] ✅ CORRECT | [ ] ❌ INCORRECT | [ ] ❓ UNCLEAR | [ ] ➡️ MODIFY

**If needs adjustment:**

- Optional marketing fields: \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***
- Content length limits: \***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***\_\_\_\***\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

We do not know what requirements are yet, but there needs to be fleksibility for what will be shown in Contentful too.

---

### 5.2 Multilingual Support

**Assumption:** Initially, the system will support single-language content per tenant, with each brand partner operating in their primary market language.

**Status:** [ ] ✅ CORRECT | [ ] ❌ INCORRECT | [X] ❓ UNCLEAR | [ ] ➡️ MODIFY

## 12. Open Questions

### 12.1 Business Process Questions

1. **Product Approval Process**: Do new products need approval before going live, or can brand partners publish immediately?

   **Answer:** They should make sure things are in the state that they need to be.

2. **Pricing Strategy**: Should the system support complex pricing rules (volume discounts, tiered pricing, promotional codes)?

   **Answer:** Promotional codes are already handled by the Campaign Service, so this is not a requirement for the Catalog Module.

3. **Product Lifecycle**: How should the system handle discontinued products that still have active customers?

   **Answer:** The catalog service is only a representation of what can be bought, not what has been bought. This means that discontinueing a catalog item does not difference since the underlying subscription is still active.

4. **Cross-Tenant Features**: Should there be any shared product catalog features, or is complete tenant isolation required?

   **Answer:** Complete isolation is required, so no shared features.

### 12.2 Technical Implementation Questions

1. **Data Synchronization**: Should product changes sync back to the TCM system, or is it one-way integration?

   **Answer:** Good question. If the catalog items have a dependency on the price on the actual subscription in tcm, then it should be a one-way integration, meaning changes in the catalog won't affect the TCM system. But we might want / need to set something up to sync infomation from TCM into the catalog service ( because we want to rely on the old system as little as we can. )

2. **Caching Strategy**: How long should TCM data be cached, and what triggers cache invalidation?

   **Answer:** We do not have good ways of cache invalidation, it might just be a manual button used in the TCM system on the subscription that then sends out a purge requests for invalidation of the cache. Cache length can be 1 hour? or even longer.

3. **Search Implementation**: Should we implement full-text search capabilities or focus on structured filtering?

   **Answer:** Searching will not be a big requirement for the catalog module, so structured filtering is enough for now, even if so, there shouldnt be many items for needing to search.

4. **API Rate Limiting**: What rate limits are appropriate for different types of users and operations?

   **Answer:** You tell me.

### 12.3 User Experience Questions

1. **Mobile Support**: Should the administration interface work on mobile devices, or is desktop/tablet sufficient?

   **Answer:** only optimised for desktop

2. **Bulk Operations**: What's the maximum number of products that should be supported in bulk operations?

   **Answer:** honestly, write out everything about bulk operations. We dont know if we want it. propably not.

3. **Error Recovery**: How should the system handle partial failures in bulk operations?

   **Answer:** honestly, write out everything about bulk operations. We dont know if we want it. propably not.

4. **Notification Preferences**: Should the system send notifications for product status changes, campaign expiration, etc.?

   **Answer:** No
