- **End Users**: Authenticate to access services and channels
- **API Consumers**: Authenticate for programmatic access to services
- **External Partners**: Authenticate through federated identity providers

### 1.3 Core Responsibilities

- Provide secure authentication services using Duende Identity Server
- Enforce multi-tenant access control and isolation
- Manage OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols
- Support federated authentication with Azure AD
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Maintain audit trails and security monitoring

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 User Authentication

#### 2.1.1 Primary Authentication Methods

- [ ] Implement OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standards
- [ ] Provide secure token-based authentication
- [ ] Support multi-factor authentication (MFA) when required
- [ ] Enforce password policies for local accounts

**Business Rules:**
- Azure AD is the primary authentication provider
- Local accounts only for system administration and emergency access
- All user passwords stored securely (hashed and salted)
- Failed login attempts trigger security monitoring
- Sessions timeout based on security policies

#### 2.1.2 API Authentication
**As an** API consumer
