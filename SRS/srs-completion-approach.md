# SRS Document Completion Approach

## Overview
This document outlines the systematic approach for completing the remaining phases of the SAGA Telecom eCommerce Module SRS document.

## Phase-by-Phase Approach

### Phase 2: Integration Requirements
**Focus**: Legacy system integrations and API specifications

1. **TCM Integration Analysis**
   - Map all touchpoints with legacy TCM system
   - Define data synchronization requirements
   - Document API contracts and error handling
   - Specify rollback and compensation strategies

2. **External Service Integrations**
   - Payment gateway integration specifications (Adyen, Stripe)
   - SMS/notification service requirements
   - Email service integration details
   - Analytics and monitoring integrations

3. **Integration Patterns**
   - Define standard integration patterns (REST, messaging, webhooks)
   - Error handling and retry policies
   - Circuit breaker implementations
   - Rate limiting and throttling

### Phase 3: Non-Functional Requirements
**Focus**: Performance, security, and operational requirements

1. **Performance Requirements**
   - Response time targets for critical operations
   - Throughput requirements by module
   - Scalability targets and growth projections
   - Database performance considerations

2. **Security Requirements**
   - Authentication and authorization specifications
   - Data encryption requirements (at rest and in transit)
   - PCI DSS compliance for payment processing
   - GDPR compliance for customer data

3. **Operational Requirements**
   - Monitoring and alerting specifications
   - Logging standards and retention policies
   - Backup and disaster recovery procedures
   - Deployment and rollback strategies

### Phase 4: Implementation Constraints
**Focus**: Technical constraints and architectural decisions

1. **Technology Stack Constraints**
   - .NET version requirements and upgrade paths
   - Database technology decisions (PostgreSQL specifics)
   - Frontend framework constraints (SvelteKit)
   - Infrastructure requirements (Kubernetes, .NET Aspire)

2. **Architectural Constraints**
   - Modular monolith boundaries and communication
   - Multi-tenancy implementation patterns
   - Data isolation and security boundaries
   - API versioning strategies

3. **Development Constraints**
   - Coding standards and conventions
   - Testing requirements and coverage targets
   - Documentation standards
   - Code review and quality gates

### Phase 5: Testing Requirements
**Focus**: Comprehensive testing strategy

1. **Testing Levels**
   - Unit testing requirements by module
   - Integration testing between modules
   - End-to-end testing scenarios
   - Performance testing specifications

2. **Test Data Management**
   - Test data generation strategies
   - Tenant-specific test data isolation
   - MSISDN pool management for testing
   - Payment gateway sandbox configurations

3. **Acceptance Criteria**
   - Functional acceptance criteria by feature
   - Performance acceptance thresholds
   - Security testing requirements
   - User acceptance testing procedures

## Working Principles

### 1. Stakeholder Engagement
- Schedule regular review sessions after each phase
- Gather specific requirements from technical teams
- Validate assumptions with business stakeholders
- Document decisions and rationale

### 2. Cross-Reference Validation
- Ensure consistency with project charter
- Validate against existing technical documentation
- Check alignment with architecture decisions
- Verify feasibility with development team

### 3. Iterative Refinement
- Complete one phase at a time
- Review and refine based on feedback
- Update earlier sections if new information emerges
- Maintain traceability between requirements

### 4. Documentation Standards
- Use consistent formatting and structure
- Include clear examples where applicable
- Provide rationale for key decisions
- Maintain version history of changes

## Questions to Address Per Phase

### Integration Requirements
- What are the exact TCM API endpoints needed?
- What is the expected latency for legacy system calls?
- How should we handle TCM system downtime?
- What are the data consistency requirements?

### Non-Functional Requirements
- What are the specific performance SLAs?
- What security certifications are required?
- What are the data retention policies?
- What are the availability targets?

### Implementation Constraints
- Are there specific .NET features to avoid/prefer?
- What are the database size projections?
- Are there licensing constraints to consider?
- What are the deployment window restrictions?

### Testing Requirements
- What is the required test coverage percentage?
- How should we handle test data for multiple tenants?
- What are the performance testing thresholds?
- Who are the UAT stakeholders?

## Success Criteria

Each phase is considered complete when:
1. All sections are filled with specific, measurable requirements
2. Stakeholder review and approval is obtained
3. Cross-references are validated and consistent
4. No critical questions remain unanswered
5. Development team confirms technical feasibility

## Timeline Considerations

- Allocate 2-3 days per phase for drafting
- Allow 1-2 days for stakeholder review
- Include buffer time for revisions
- Plan for iterative refinement cycles

This approach ensures systematic completion while maintaining alignment between business needs and technical implementation.
