  --body "## Epic Overview
Establish the development environment and initial solution structure for the SAGA eCommerce platform.

## Business Value
Enable the 4-developer team to start building features immediately with a consistent, well-configured development environment.

## Epic Timeline
Target: End of January 2025 (2-3 weeks)

## Success Criteria
- All developers can run the application locally
- Initial solution structure is in place with modular monolith pattern
- Multi-tenant infrastructure foundation is operational
- CI/CD pipeline is functional
- First FastEndpoints are implemented and tested
