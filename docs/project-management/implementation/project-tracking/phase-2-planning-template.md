# Phase 2: Core Module Development Planning

## Overview

Phase 2 focuses on implementing the core business modules for the SAGA eCommerce platform. This phase builds upon the completed foundation (Phase 1) to deliver tenant-aware business functionality.

## Phase 2 Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Tenant Management Module:** Complete tenant lifecycle management
- **Product Catalog Module:** Full product catalog with search capabilities
- **Channel Management Module:** Sales channel configuration and visibility rules
- **Production Readiness:** Performance, monitoring, and deployment preparation

### Success Criteria
- All modules implement proper multi-tenant isolation using Finbuckle
- APIs follow established design standards and patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage including tenant isolation verification
- Performance meets requirements (API response < 200ms, tenant isolation verified)
- Ready for production deployment with monitoring

## Module Development Sequence

### Sequence Rationale
The modules are ordered based on dependencies and business priority:

1. **Product Catalog** (Core Business) - Primary eCommerce functionality
2. **Channel Management** (Business Logic) - Depends on product catalog
3. **Number Management** (Telecom-Specific) - MSISDN and SIM card management

**Note:** Tenant management is handled by external solution integration via Finbuckle.MultiTenant framework.

## Phase 2 Epics Overview

### Epic 1: Product Catalog Module  
**Duration:** 4-5 weeks | **Team:** 2-3 developers  
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 foundation complete

- Search and discovery capabilities
- Foundation for all telecom product offerings

**Key Features:**
- Product and category management
- Tenant-aware product catalogs
- Search implementation with filtering
- Product visibility and availability rules
- Telecom-specific product types (subscriptions, devices, SIM cards)

### Epic 2: Channel Management Module
**Duration:** 3-4 weeks | **Team:** 2 developers  
**Dependencies:** Product Catalog complete

**Business Value:**
- Sales channel configuration per tenant
- Product visibility control across channels
- Multi-channel sales strategy support

**Key Features:**
- Channel definition and configuration
- Channel-specific product visibility
- Pricing and availability by channel
- Channel analytics foundation

### Epic 3: Number Management Module
**Duration:** 4-5 weeks | **Team:** 2-3 developers  
**Dependencies:** Product Catalog complete (parallel with Channel Management)

**Business Value:**
- Complete MSISDN lifecycle management
- Number portability and reservation
- SIM card management (pSIM/eSIM)
- Integration with telecom carrier systems

**Key Features:**
- MSISDN allocation and management
- Number portability workflow
- SIM card provisioning and activation
- Number inventory and availability tracking
- Integration with TCM legacy systems

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Multi-Tenant Architecture Compliance
All modules must implement:

```csharp
// Entity Configuration
modelBuilder.Entity<Product>().IsMultiTenant();

// Service Access Pattern
public class ProductService
{
    private readonly IMultiTenantContextAccessor<TenantInfo> _tenantAccessor;
    
    public async Task<List<Product>> GetProductsAsync()
    {
        // Finbuckle automatically filters by current tenant
        return await _context.Products.ToListAsync();
    }
}

// API Endpoint Pattern
public class GetProductsEndpoint : Endpoint<GetProductsRequest, GetProductsResponse>
{
    public override async Task HandleAsync(GetProductsRequest req, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var tenantInfo = _tenantAccessor.MultiTenantContext?.TenantInfo;
        // Implementation automatically tenant-aware
    }
}
```

### API Design Standards
Established patterns for all modules:

- **Endpoints:** `/api/{module}/{resource}` (e.g., `/api/catalog/products`)
- **Tenant Headers:** X-Tenant-Id required for all operations
- **Error Handling:** Consistent Problem Details responses
- **Validation:** FluentValidation for all requests
- **Documentation:** OpenAPI/Swagger for all endpoints

### Testing Requirements
Each module must include:

- **Unit Tests:** 80%+ coverage with Finbuckle scenarios
- **Integration Tests:** Tenant isolation verification
- **API Tests:** Full request/response cycle testing
- **Performance Tests:** Response time and throughput validation

## Development Workflow

### Module Development Process
1. **Epic Kickoff** (Day 1)
   - Architecture review session
   - Story breakdown and estimation
   - Technical spike identification

2. **Sprint Planning** (Ongoing)
   - 2-week iterations
   - Story prioritization
   - Cross-module dependency tracking

3. **Implementation Standards**
   - Code review checklist with tenant considerations
   - PR template requiring tenant isolation verification
   - Continuous integration with automated testing

4. **Module Completion**
   - Integration testing with other modules
   - Performance validation
   - Documentation update

### Quality Gates
Before module completion:

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation verified
- [ ] API documentation complete
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Security review completed

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Multi-tenant complexity:** Mitigated by Finbuckle patterns and comprehensive testing
- **Performance concerns:** Address with early performance testing and optimization
- **Integration challenges:** Manage with clear module interfaces and contracts

### Process Risks
- **Scope creep:** Control with clear acceptance criteria and change management
- **Dependency delays:** Minimize with parallel development where possible
- **Team coordination:** Address with regular sync meetings and clear communication

## Resource Planning

### Team Structure
- **2-3 Backend Developers:** Module implementation
- **1 DevOps/Infrastructure:** CI/CD and deployment
- **1 QA/Testing:** Test strategy and automation
- **1 Product Owner:** Requirements and acceptance

### Timeline Estimation
```
Phase 2 Timeline (10-12 weeks total):

Weeks 1-5:  Product Catalog Module
Weeks 4-7:  Channel Management Module (parallel start)  
Weeks 4-9:  Number Management Module (parallel start)
Weeks 8-12: Integration & Production Readiness
```

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Development:** Aspire orchestration with SQL Server
- **Testing:** Automated test environments with tenant data
- **Staging:** Production-like environment for integration testing
- **Monitoring:** Application insights and tenant-specific dashboards

## Success Metrics
