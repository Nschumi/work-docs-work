**Filter 3: Ready for Review**
- Name: `üëÅÔ∏è Needs Review`
- Filter: `Status = "Code Review"`

**Filter 4: High Priority**
- Name: `üî• High Priority`

```
Title: [STORY] As a team I want CI/CD pipeline validation
Module: Infrastructure
Iteration: Iteration 0 - Foundation  
Story Points: 2
Priority Score: 3
Labels: type:story, module:infrastructure, priority:high
```
