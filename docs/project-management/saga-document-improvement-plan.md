# Document Improvement Plan - SAGA Telecom eCommerce Module

**Date:** 2025-07-31  
**Prepared by:** Claude (Pragmatic Project Manager)  
**Status:** Initial Assessment Complete

## Executive Summary

This document provides a structured improvement plan for the Project Charter and SRS documents, with prioritized actions to ensure they serve as effective alignment tools between business and engineering teams.

**Key Findings:**
- Project Charter is ~80% complete but needs stronger business-engineering linkage
- SRS is comprehensive (~95% complete) but overly technical and lengthy
- Both documents need better cross-referencing and alignment

- **Target Audience:** Heavy engineering focus

### Strengths
1. Exceptional technical detail and architecture clarity
2. Comprehensive non-functional requirements
3. Strong security and compliance coverage
4. Excellent implementation guidance

### Gaps & Issues

#### 2.1 Overwhelming Length

## 4. Critical Clarifying Questions for Stakeholders

### Business Questions (for Lars & Bjørn)

1. **Resource Commitment**
   - Are the 6-8 developers confirmed and budgeted?
   - When will each developer join the project?
   - Is there contingency for additional resources?

2. **Budget & ROI**
   - What is the total approved budget?
   - What are the expected cost savings from reduced onboarding?
   - How many partners are committed for Year 1?

3. **Success Criteria**

   - What's the minimum viable feature set for first partner?
   - What would trigger project cancellation?

### Technical Questions (for Niclas)

4. **Legacy System Access**
   - What's our actual access level to TCM system?
   - Are there rate limits or availability windows?
   - Who owns the integration approval?

5. **Technology Constraints**

## Conclusion

Both documents have strong foundations but need targeted improvements to serve as effective business-engineering alignment tools. The priority is making them more accessible and actionable while maintaining technical accuracy. Focus on creating clear linkages between business goals and technical implementation.

**Key Success Factor:** These documents must be living artifacts that teams actually reference, not static compliance checkboxes.
