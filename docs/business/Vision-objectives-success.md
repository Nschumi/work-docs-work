## Vision

### What is the overarching purpose of the e-commerce module within the whitelabel telecom system?

The current system is not a whitelabel system, each website is a seperate instance, which currently is build on a legacy system (TCM)
Though we know TCM is going to be replaced, we do not know how yet. But we want to deattach the e-commerce module from TCM, so it can be used in a whitelabel system in the future.
The eCom pillar will be the last of the 3 pillars to be migrated to the new system, so it is important that the eCom module is designed in such a way that it can be used in a whitelabel system in the future.
The ecom module should be able to support multiple tenants, each with their own branding and configuration, while sharing a common codebase. It should also be able to handle different product offerings and pricing strategies across tenants, allowing for flexibility and scalability in the telecom e-commerce landscape.
The ecom module should be designed to support a modular monolith architecture, allowing for easy integration with other services and components within the telecom system. It should also be able to handle high volumes of traffic and transactions, ensuring a seamless user experience across all digital channels.

### How do you envision this module transforming the user or business experience?

The e-commerce module is envisioned to transform the user experience by providing a seamless, intuitive, and personalized shopping journey across multiple digital channels. It will enable customers to easily browse, compare, and purchase telecom products with tailored offerings based on their preferences and behaviors. For businesses, it will streamline operations by centralizing product management, pricing strategies, and promotional campaigns, allowing for quick adaptations to market changes and customer demands.
The flexibility for brand partners to be able to choose the Whitelabel solution OR to choice an API first approach, will allow for a more tailored experience for each brand partner, while still maintaining a common codebase. This will enable faster time-to-market for new brands and products, as well as easier maintenance and updates across the platform.

### What long-term impact should this project have on the organization and its customers?

The capability to support multiple tenants with their own branding and configuration will enable the organization to expand its market reach and cater to diverse customer segments. This will lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty, as users will have a more personalized experience that meets their specific needs. Additionally, the modular monolith architecture will facilitate easier integration with future technologies and services, ensuring the organization remains agile and competitive in the rapidly evolving telecom landscape.
Being able to onboard more brands without the need for extensive custom development will significantly reduce time-to-market for new offerings, allowing the organization to quickly adapt to market trends and customer demands. This will also enhance operational efficiency, as shared components can be reused across different tenants, leading to cost savings and improved resource utilization.

### How does this module align with the company’s broader mission or strategic goals?

It will be the last of 3 pillars to be migrated to the new system, so it is important that the eCom module is designed in such a way that it can be used in a whitelabel system in the future.
Shifting left is a key aspect of this project, ensuring each brand can manage their own product offerings and pricing strategies while maintaining a common codebase. This aligns with the company's strategic goal of enhancing operational efficiency and reducing time-to-market for new products and services.

## Objectives

### What are the top 3–5 outcomes you want to achieve with this project?

- Enable the e-commerce module to support multiple tenants with distinct branding and configurations, allowing for a whitelabel solution.
- Ensure the e-commerce module can handle different product offerings and pricing strategies across tenants, providing flexibility and scalability.
- Design the e-commerce module to be modular and easily integrable with other services, facilitating a seamless user experience across digital channels.
- Establish a robust architecture that supports high traffic volumes and transactions, ensuring reliability and performance.
- Create a centralized product management system that allows for quick adaptations to market changes and customer demands.

### Who are the primary users or customers, and what specific needs should the module address for them?

- The primary users are telecom brand partners and their customers. The module should address the following needs:
  - For brand partners: Ability to manage their own product offerings, pricing strategies, and promotional campaigns without extensive custom development.
  - For customers: A seamless, intuitive shopping experience that allows easy browsing, comparison, and purchasing of telecom products across multiple digital channels.

Brand partners should be through using the CMS ( contentful) and the e-commerce module to managage everything they need. Not communicate with the IT team to do what should be self-service.

### What business problems or opportunities are you aiming to solve?

Moderinzing the e-commerce platform to support a whitelabel solution will address the current limitations of the legacy system (TCM) by enabling faster onboarding of new brands and products. This will also provide an opportunity to enhance customer experience through personalized offerings and streamlined operations. The project aims to solve the problem of scalability and flexibility in managing multiple tenants, allowing for a more agile response to market demands.

Are there specific KPIs or metrics that will indicate the project’s success?
If we are to have any issues with the e-commerce module, we should be able to identify them quickly and resolve them without impacting the customer experience. This will be measured through:

- System performance metrics (response time, uptime, transaction volume).

Further more, our system should tell us about faults or high error rates before the brand or support teams notice them, allowing for proactive issue resolution. This will be measured through:

- Monitoring and alerting systems that track error rates and system health.

### What does a successful launch look like from the perspective of different stakeholders (e.g., customers, partners, internal teams)?

We will launch in multiple milestones, starting with a pilot brand partner to validate the e-commerce module's functionality and performance. A successful launch will include:

- For customers: A seamless and intuitive shopping experience with no disruptions or issues during the transition.
- For brand partners: Ability to manage their own product offerings and configurations through the CMS without needing IT intervention.
- For internal teams: A well-documented and modular e-commerce module that integrates smoothly with existing systems, allowing for easy maintenance and updates.
  transparency into the orders and customer interactions, enabling quick resolution of any issues that arise.

Are there any regulatory, compliance, or industry standards the module must meet?

- The e-commerce module must comply with telecom industry regulations, data protection laws (e.g., GDPR), and payment processing standards (e.g., PCI DSS).
- It should also adhere to accessibility standards to ensure all customers can use the platform effectively.

## Success Criteria

## How will you measure whether the vision and objectives have been met?

Milestones will be established for each phase of the project, with specific KPIs to track progress. Success will be measured by:

- Meeting the defined objectives within the project timeline and budget.
- Achieving performance benchmarks (e.g., system response time, transaction volume).
- Positive feedback from brand partners and customers during the pilot phase.

## What are the “must-have” features for launch versus “nice-to-have” enhancements?
