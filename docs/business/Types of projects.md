You are correct that a structured documentation process is essential, but the optimal sequence and purpose of each document type can differ based on project needs and organizational practices. Here’s a recommended approach for telecom eCommerce modular monolith projects, with concrete steps and rationale for each document type:

## Recommended Documentation Sequence

### 1. **Project Document (Project/Business Requirements Document)**

- **Purpose:** Establishes business context, objectives, high-level scope, stakeholders, and major milestones.
- **Audience:** Business stakeholders, product owners, architects, and tech leads.
- **Timing:** Always comes first. Sets the foundation for all downstream technical and product work.
- **Contents:** Project overview, business goals, scope, integration points, high-level architecture, epics, and milestones[1][4].

### 2. **Technical Product Specification**

- **Purpose:** Translates business needs into detailed product requirements and acceptance criteria.
- **Audience:** Product managers, business analysts, QA, and tech leads.
- **Timing:** Follows the project document. Should be completed before or in parallel with technical design, especially for complex features.
- **Contents:** Feature list, user stories, technical and non-functional requirements, constraints, acceptance criteria, and user journeys[3][6].

### 3. **Technical Design Document**

- **Purpose:** Provides a detailed blueprint for how the system or module will be implemented, covering architecture, data models, APIs, and integration patterns.
- **Audience:** Developers, architects, QA, and DevOps.
- **Timing:** Starts after the product specification is mature. In agile projects, this may be iterative and refined as requirements evolve.
- **Contents:** Component diagrams, data flows, API contracts, algorithms, integration details, error handling, and design rationale[2][5].

## Why This Order?

- **Project Document first:** Ensures all stakeholders agree on the “why” and “what” before investing in detailed requirements or design.
- **Technical Product Specification second:** Clarifies exactly “what” needs to be built, reducing the risk of missed requirements or scope creep.
- **Technical Design Document last:** Defines “how” the system will be built, ensuring alignment with both business goals and detailed requirements.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Skipping or blending steps:** Jumping straight to technical design without clear business goals or requirements leads to rework and misalignment.
- **Mixing business and technical details:** Keep business context, product requirements, and technical implementation clearly separated for clarity and traceability.
- **Outdated documentation:** Regularly update documents as requirements or designs change, and maintain version history[4].

---

## Concrete Implementation Steps

- **Step 1:** Draft the Project Document with business context, high-level scope, and epics. Review and sign off with stakeholders.
- **Step 2:** Develop Technical Product Specifications for each major feature or module, including user stories and acceptance criteria.
- **Step 3:** Write Technical Design Documents for each service or component, referencing the product specs and detailing architecture and APIs.
- **Step 4:** Use ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) to document major design choices during the process[1].
- **Step 5:** Link Jira tasks to relevant document sections and acceptance criteria.

## Summary Table

| Step | Document Type                   | Purpose                         | Output Example                                |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Project Document                | Set business context & scope    | Catalog Service Technical Project Document    |
| 2    | Technical Product Specification | Define detailed requirements    | Feature/user story specs, acceptance criteria |
| 3    | Technical Design Document       | Detail technical implementation | Channel Service Technical Design Document     |

---

**In summary:**  
Start with the Project Document, then move to Technical Product Specifications, and finally create Technical Design Documents. This sequence ensures clarity, traceability, and alignment between business goals, product requirements, and technical implementation—critical for success in telecom eCom modular monolith projects[1][2][3][5].
