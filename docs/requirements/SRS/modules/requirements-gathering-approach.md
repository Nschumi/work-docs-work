# Requirements Gathering Approach - SAGA Telecom eCommerce Module

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-07-10  
**Author:** Principal Engineer  
**Purpose:** Document the successful requirements gathering approach for future module development

---

## Overview

This document captures the successful two-step requirements gathering approach used for the Catalog Module, which should be replicated for all subsequent modules in the SAGA Telecom eCommerce project.

## The Two-Step Approach

### Step 1: Create Initial Requirements Document

Create a comprehensive requirements document based on available information and industry best practices. This document should include:

1. **Module Overview**
   - Purpose and key users
   - Core responsibilities
   - Integration points

2. **Functional Requirements** 
   - User stories with acceptance criteria
   - Business rules and validation
   - Questions for stakeholder clarification

3. **Technical Specifications**
   - API requirements with endpoint examples
   - Data models and relationships
   - Performance targets
   - Security requirements

4. **Open Questions**
   - Business process clarifications
   - Technical implementation decisions
   - Integration details

### Step 2: Create Assumptions-Based Questionnaire

Transform the requirements document into a questionnaire that:

1. **States Clear Assumptions**
   - Present each requirement as an assumption
   - Be specific about technical choices
   - Include concrete examples

2. **Provides Simple Response Options**
   - ✅ CORRECT - Assumption is accurate
   - ❌ INCORRECT - Needs correction
   - ❓ UNCLEAR - Needs clarification  
   - ➡️ MODIFY - Directionally correct but needs adjustment

3. **Captures Detailed Feedback**
   - Space for corrections under each assumption
   - Open-ended questions for complex topics
   - Business context questions

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. Reduces Stakeholder Cognitive Load
- Reviewing assumptions is easier than creating requirements from scratch
- Clear structure guides the review process
- Specific examples prevent misunderstandings

### 2. Accelerates Requirements Gathering
- Stakeholders can quickly mark items as correct
- Only incorrect items need detailed discussion
- Parallel review of multiple sections possible

### 3. Improves Requirement Quality
- Assumptions based on industry standards provide good baseline
- Stakeholder corrections ensure business alignment
- Technical and business perspectives are balanced

### 4. Creates Clear Audit Trail
- Original assumptions are documented
- All changes are traceable to stakeholder feedback
- Rationale for decisions is captured

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Requirements Document

1. **Be Comprehensive but Organized**
   - Use clear section numbering
   - Group related requirements together
   - Provide context for each section

2. **Include Specific Examples**
   - API request/response samples
   - Data model examples
   - User flow scenarios

3. **Highlight Uncertainties**
   - Mark areas needing stakeholder input
   - List alternative approaches
   - Note dependencies on other decisions

### For Questionnaire

1. **Make Assumptions Specific**
   ```
   BAD:  "The system will support product search"
   GOOD: "API consumers will search products by: name, price range, 
          data allowance, binding period, category, and campaigns"
   ```

2. **Group Related Items**
   - Keep technical items together
   - Group business rules in sections
   - Separate current vs. future requirements

3. **Provide Context**
   - Explain why each assumption matters
   - Note impacts of different choices
   - Reference related decisions

## Module-Specific Considerations

### Phase 1 Modules

1. **Catalog Module** ✅ (Completed)
   - Focus: Product management and TCM integration
   - Key decisions: Pricing strategy, variant handling

2. **Channel Module** (Next)
   - Focus: Multi-channel product visibility
   - Key decisions: Channel types, inheritance rules

3. **Authentication Module** (Next)
   - Focus: Multi-tenant security and SSO
   - Key decisions: Identity provider, token strategy

### Phase 2 Modules

1. **Basket/Cart Module**
   - Focus: Shopping cart persistence
   - Key decisions: Cart lifecycle, pricing calculations

2. **Order Module**
   - Focus: Order processing workflow
   - Key decisions: State machine, provisioning integration

3. **Payment Module**
   - Focus: Payment processing and security
   - Key decisions: Payment methods, recurring billing

4. **Number Management Module**
   - Focus: MSISDN lifecycle management
   - Key decisions: Number allocation, porting process

### Phase 3 Modules

1. **Customer Module**
   - Focus: Customer profile and preferences
   - Key decisions: Data model, privacy compliance

2. **Whitelabel Customization Module**
   - Focus: Tenant branding and configuration
   - Key decisions: Customization boundaries, theme system

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics to ensure the approach remains effective:

1. **Stakeholder Satisfaction**
   - Time to complete questionnaire (target: < 2 hours)
   - Number of clarification requests (minimize)
   - Confidence in final requirements

2. **Requirement Quality**
   - Number of changes during development
   - Missing requirements discovered late
   - Rework due to misunderstandings

3. **Process Efficiency**
   - Time from initial document to approved requirements
   - Number of review cycles needed
   - Stakeholder availability issues

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Assumptions-based approach** reduced stakeholder effort
2. **Specific examples** prevented misinterpretation
3. **Open questions section** captured important context
4. **Technical + business balance** ensured completeness

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Bulk operations** - Don't assume these are needed
2. **Image handling** - Consider CMS integration early
3. **Search complexity** - Start simple, enhance if needed
4. **Scale assumptions** - Verify realistic numbers early

## Templates Location

Standard templates for requirements documents and questionnaires are stored in:
- `/SRS/modules/templates/requirements-template.md`
- `/SRS/modules/templates/questionnaire-template.md`

## Conclusion

This two-step approach has proven effective for gathering detailed, accurate requirements while minimizing stakeholder effort. By presenting well-researched assumptions for validation rather than asking open-ended questions, we can accelerate the requirements process while maintaining quality.

The key to success is balancing technical expertise with business needs, always being willing to adjust assumptions based on stakeholder feedback, and maintaining clear documentation throughout the process.
