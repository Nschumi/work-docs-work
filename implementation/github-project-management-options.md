gh issue create --title "Setup Multi-Tenant Infrastructure" --body "Detailed description..."

# Create project board
gh project create --title "SAGA eCommerce Phase 1"

# Create labels
gh label create "module:catalog" --color "blue"
gh label create "priority:high" --color "red"

# Create milestones
gh milestone create "Phase 1 - Foundation" --due-date "2025-10-01"
```

## GitHub Project Management Options

### Option 1: GitHub Issues + Projects (Classic)
**Pros:**
- Simple, familiar interface
- Good for basic task tracking
- Integrated with code workflow
- Free for private repositories

**Cons:**
- Limited advanced project management features
- No time tracking
- Basic reporting capabilities

### Option 2: GitHub Projects (Beta/New)
**Pros:**
- Modern kanban boards
- Custom fields and views
- Better filtering and sorting
- Integrated with issues and PRs
- Timeline/roadmap views

**Cons:**
- Still in development
- Some features may be limited
- Learning curve for team

### Option 3: GitHub Issues + Third-party Integration
**Pros:**
- Keep GitHub as source of truth
- Enhanced reporting via third-party tools
- Better visualization options

**Cons:**
- Additional complexity
- Potential cost for third-party tools

## Recommended Approach for Your Project

### Phase 1: GitHub Projects (New) + Issues

Given your preferences and Claude's capabilities, I recommend:

1. **GitHub Projects (New)** for project management
2. **GitHub Issues** for task tracking
3. **GitHub Milestones** for sprint/phase organization
4. **GitHub Labels** for categorization

### Project Structure I Can Create:

```
SAGA Telecom eCommerce
├── Milestones
│   ├── Phase 1 - Foundation (Oct 2025)
│   ├── Sprint 1 - Infrastructure
│   ├── Sprint 2 - Multi-tenancy
│   └── Sprint 3 - Catalog Module
├── Labels
│   ├── module:catalog
│   ├── module:channel
│   ├── module:tenant
│   ├── priority:high/medium/low
│   ├── type:epic/story/task/bug
│   └── status:blocked/in-review
└── Issue Templates
    ├── Epic Template
    ├── Story Template
    ├── Task Template
    └── Bug Report Template
```

### Project Board Views:

1. **Sprint Planning**: Current sprint tasks
2. **Module View**: Grouped by module (catalog, channel, etc.)
3. **Priority View**: High → Medium → Low
4. **Developer View**: Assigned to team members
5. **Timeline View**: Roadmap with dependencies

## Do You Need an MCP?

### Short Answer: No, not for basic project management

### Long Answer:

**GitHub CLI is sufficient for:**
- Creating and managing issues
- Setting up project boards
- Organizing tasks and milestones
- Linking code to issues
- Basic reporting and status tracking

**You might want an MCP for:**
- Advanced project analytics
- Complex workflow automation
- Integration with external tools (Jira, Slack, etc.)
- Custom GitHub app development
- Advanced reporting and dashboards

## What Claude Can Set Up For You

### Immediate Setup (5-10 minutes):
1. Create GitHub repository structure
2. Set up issue templates
3. Create project board with appropriate columns
4. Generate initial labels and milestones
5. Create first epic and story issues

### Project Organization (15-20 minutes):
1. Break down Phase 1 into sprints
2. Create detailed user stories and tasks
3. Set up GitHub Actions for automated workflows
4. Create PR templates and branch protection
5. Generate project documentation

### Example Issue Structure I Can Create:

```
Epic: Multi-Tenant Infrastructure
├── Story: Implement Tenant Context and Middleware
│   ├── Task: Create ITenantContext interface
│   ├── Task: Implement TenantMiddleware
│   └── Task: Add tenant resolution strategies
├── Story: Database Multi-Tenancy Support
│   ├── Task: Create TenantAwareEntity base class
│   ├── Task: Implement tenant filtering in DbContext
│   └── Task: Add tenant migration support
└── Story: Authentication Integration
    ├── Task: Integrate with Identity service
    ├── Task: Implement JWT token validation

- Supports your "quick prototype, iterate" style

✅ **Perfect for your timeline:**
- Quick setup (I can do it in one session)
- Immediate productivity
- Easy to refactor as needs evolve
- No learning curve for developers

## Next Steps

If you're ready to proceed, I can:

1. **Create the GitHub repository structure** with all project management components
2. **Generate the initial issue backlog** based on your questionnaire responses
3. **Set up the project board** with appropriate workflows
4. **Create the first sprint** with specific, actionable tasks

Would you like me to proceed with setting up the GitHub project structure, or do you have questions about any of these options?
