## Critical Path

```
GitHub Questionnaire → GitHub Project Setup → Sprint Planning → Implementation Start
         ↓
FastEndpoints Plan → Technical Templates → Development Environment
```

## Immediate Actions Needed

### 1. **GitHub Questionnaire Completion** (BLOCKING)
- **Your Action:** Complete remaining questions in `github-project-setup-questionnaire.md`
- **Impact:** Blocks sprint planning and task creation
- **Time:** ~10 minutes

### 2. **FastEndpoints Integration Plan** (CURRENT)
- **My Action:** Continue creating FastEndpoints implementation document
- **Impact:** Enables technical architecture completion
- **Time:** ~15 minutes

### 3. **Sprint Planning** (NEXT)
- **My Action:** Create Phase 1 sprint goals and task breakdown
- **Dependency:** GitHub questionnaire completion
- **Time:** ~20 minutes

## Decision Points Awaiting Resolution

| Decision | Options | Impact | Current Status |
|----------|---------|--------|----------------|
| GitHub project board columns | Basic vs Detailed vs Custom | Development workflow | Partially answered |
| Sprint duration | 1-4 weeks | Timeline planning | Not answered |
| Issue assignment strategy | Auto vs Manual vs Self-assign | Team coordination | Not answered |
| Branch naming convention | Multiple patterns | Git workflow | Not answered |

## Risk Assessment

### 🟡 Medium Risk Items
- **GitHub questionnaire completion delay** - Could slow down sprint planning
- **Multiple parallel planning threads** - Risk of inconsistency

### 🟢 Low Risk Items
- **Technical architecture decisions** - Clear path forward
- **Implementation readiness** - No blockers identified

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Complete FastEndpoints integration plan** (My task - 15 min)
2. **Complete GitHub questionnaire** (Your task - 10 min)
3. **Generate GitHub project structure** (My task - 10 min)
4. **Create Phase 1 sprint plan** (My task - 20 min)

## Thread Resolution Status

### ✅ Resolved Threads

## Automated Status Management

**🤖 Claude Code Agent Responsibilities:**

This document serves as the **single source of truth** for all project planning activities and **must be automatically maintained** by the Claude Code agent throughout the project lifecycle.

### Agent Update Requirements:

1. **Status Updates**: Automatically update thread status (✅ → 🔄 → ⏳) as work progresses
2. **Progress Tracking**: Update percentage completion and next actions in real-time
3. **Blocker Management**: Identify and escalate new blockers immediately
4. **Timeline Adjustments**: Recalculate critical path when dependencies change
5. **Decision Recording**: Document all architectural and planning decisions made
6. **Risk Assessment**: Continuously evaluate and update risk levels

### Trigger Events for Updates:

- **Document Creation**: New planning documents → Add to completed/in-progress
- **Questionnaire Updates**: User input → Update dependency chains
- **Technical Decisions**: Architecture choices → Update implementation readiness
- **Timeline Changes**: New deadlines → Recalculate critical path
- **Team Feedback**: Requirements changes → Cascade impact assessment

### Update Frequency:

- **Real-time**: During active planning sessions
- **Session End**: Comprehensive status update before session close
- **Weekly**: Review and validate all thread status accuracy
- **Milestone Points**: Full audit and recalibration

### Quality Assurance:

- **No Orphaned Threads**: Every planning activity must be tracked
- **Dependency Validation**: Ensure all dependencies are accurately reflected
- **Status Consistency**: Cross-check status across all planning documents
- **Timeline Accuracy**: Validate critical path and timeline estimates
